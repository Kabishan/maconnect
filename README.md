Hello everyone. I'm fairly certain that no one
is going to be looking at my application. Oh,
well. If you managed to find this website or
my Github profile, thank you so
much for visiting.

## Inspiration

Due to COVID-19, I lost my co-op position. Instead of breaking down and wondering what would have happened had COVID-19 not taken place, I decided to use this time to do something that I enjoy doing. Shout-out to my friends, Cameron Orr and Devon Miller-Junk for inspiring me to build this application. They are successful and talented web developers. You can look at the wonderful things that they have created on their Github profiles.

Once again, thank you to these two for inspiring me. They taught me a lot about web development during my first hack-a-thon. I am very lucky to have worked with these two.

I would also like to thank Brad Traversy. He is a God at web development and can explain concepts very well. Please support him by watching his YouTube videos, becoming a patron or buying his courses on Udemy. He helped me a lot with developing this application. He is doing the Lord's work.

I built this application as a means of further developing my skills as a web developer and learning the nuances of technology.

In this application, I used React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose.js and a CSS template created by Brad Traversy. This is a full stack web application.

## Additional Notes and Realizations

I have realized from building this application that there are many intricacies in web development. Web development is a difficult task. This realization has made me appreciate the work that goes behind the websites that we use on a daily basis. For example, banking websites, search engines and social media platforms. I cannot imagine the numerous hours spent on constructing, maintaining and perfecting these websites. We often take these services for granted. Thank you all for listening, that is, if anyone is reading this. The sad truth is that no one will read this. Good luck, stay safe and stay healthy.
